# Team LocalHost EduTech Domain

Our project, *LocalHost-AI*, offers an innovative solution that transforms various media formats—such as videos (PPT, PDF, YouTube videos, MP3 files)—into intelligently generated questions. By leveraging the AssemblyAI API for speech-to-text conversion, we extract the audio content and subsequently use Gemini to create relevant questions based on the extracted text. The platform also features a comprehensive leaderboard to track user performance and explore assignments for general purposes. Users can view their previous tests and current results, with the added ability to reattempt any tests, fostering an engaging and personalized learning experience.
